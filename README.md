# FizzBuzz
Basic coding challenge in javaScript

A javaScript script has been written that prints the number 1 to 100 so that:

If the number is a multiple of 3, "Fizz" is printed instead of that number.
If the number is a multiple of 5, "Buzz" is printed instead of that number.
If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5 (or 15), "FizzBuzz" is printed instead of that number.
